		My name is Stefan, I live in Frankfurt and I’m actually not a designer. My educational background makes me an economist, but professionally-wise I’m a processes- and IT-manager and I work at SPIRIANT, 
		a Lufthansa subsidiary delivering inflight equipment (so basically everything that has to do with the onboard service on an airplane but the food itself). I’ve worked in a lot of different IT projects, 
		and what was most exciting to me were projects using the agile approach and anything related to UX design, for example I am the project manager and product owner for an internal sales application we use at SPIRIANT.  
		That’s why I decided to apply for the “Lufthansa Forstering Digitalization Talent” program - and that’s how I got in touch with CareerFoundry. After having completed the UX Fundamentals and the UX Immersion courses,
		I decided to take the frontend design course.
